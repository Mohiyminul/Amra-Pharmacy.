	<p class="pd8">The concept of time is self-evident. An hour consists of a certain number of minutes, a day of hours and a year of days. But we rarely think about the fundamental nature of time. Time is passing non-stop, and we follow it with clocks and calendars.
   <br><br>
    <b>We value every time and it is our responsibility and duty to provide the right service in time.</b>It is our sole duty to transport emergency medicine in time.
